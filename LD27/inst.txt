You start out in a jungle not remembering anything, who you are, where you are, why you are here...
You find a GPS on the ground next to you, it has coordinates in it.

Your task, if you choose to accept it, is to follow the GPS in aid of finding clues as to why you are where you are.

Controls:
	W - Forward
	S - Backward
